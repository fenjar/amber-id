# AMBER-ID: Avatar Motion-Based Embeddings for Re-Identification
Implementation of the Master Thesis (TU Berlin, 2025)

AMBER-ID (Avatar Motion-Based Embedding for Re-Identification) is an end-to-end framework for evaluating the privacy of avatar-anonymized talking-head videos.
It investigates whether behavioral biometric information—specifically facial motion dynamics—can still be exploited to identify individuals, even when all appearance-based cues have been replaced by an avatar.

This repository contains the full implementation used in the thesis “Assessing Privacy of Anonymized Video”, including preprocessing, model training, and evaluation pipelines.
