# Source Datasets
DID-D is the collection of three source datasets: RAVDESS, CREMA-D, NVIDIA-VC Subset. The DID-D was created using the following ressources:
- [RAVDESS](https://zenodo.org/record/1188976)
- [CREMA-D](https://github.com/CheyneyComputerScience/CREMA-D)
- [NVFAIR-VS License available](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/nxp/nvfair/)

The system on which the DID-D is based follows the NVIDIA paper on Avatar Fingerprinting by Prashnani et al. (2024): [Avatar Fingerprinting](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/nxp/avatar-fingerprinting/)
